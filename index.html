						<a class="main-link" href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn" target="_blank">
							Learning How to Learn</a> is an online course that is free-to-audit. The course is taught by national
						treasure,
						<a class="main-link" href="https://barbaraoakley.com/" target="_blank">Barbara Oakley, Ph.D.</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
						The course title is an accurate description of the subject matter. Dr. Oakley teamed up with computational
						neuroscientist,
						<a class="main-link" href="https://www.salk.edu/scientist/terrence-sejnowski/">Terrance Sejnowski,
							Ph.D.</a>, to develop a lesson plan that's
						based in behavioral and neuroscientific research, but is presented in such an approachable way that it
						feels
						like regular common sense.
					</p>
					<p>
						Learning How to Learn is the first
						<a class="main-link" href="https://www.classcentral.com/help/moocs" target="_blank">MOOC</a>
						that I ever completed in its entirety. Taking this class cultivated an enthusiasm for learning in me t
						hat I have found to be very beneficial for my personal and professional well-being.
						After completing the course, I truly believe that given enough time and access to the internet,
						the average person can learn how to do <em>almost</em> anything.

					<h3>Focused Learning</h3>
					<p>
						When you are actively studying a subject, you are practicing focused learning.
						Examples of focused learning include reading a book, watching a lecture,
						or practicing a scale on an instrument.
						Basically, focused learning is when you are consciously doing work to familiarize yourself with a new
						concept.
					</p>
					<h3>Diffuse Learning</h3>
					<p>
						Diffuse learning occurs in times when you are not actively engaged in learning anything at all. It's the
						reason why people have great ideas in the shower and
						it's the reason why after 6 years of cramming for French tests in highschool, I can barely remember how to
						count to neuve (and just had to google the spelling).
					</p>
					<p>
						The concept of diffuse learning was completely unknown to me before taking the course, but I think it makes
						a
						lot of sense. In order for an idea to really stick,
						your brain is going to need a minute to rest and reconfigure.

					<h3>The Pomodoro Method</h3>
					<p>
						Do 25 mins of studying (focused learning), then take a break. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, elitr viderer
						officiis vel ei, ex timeam necessitatibus mel, vix doctus scripserit accommodare et.
						Eu vide sale vel, nec ut augue affert moderatius. Et quaeque officiis evertitur vel, vel dicit efficiantur
						id.
						Duis magna illum ei pro, dignissim temporibus an his.
					</p>
					<h3>Chunking</h3>
					<p>
						Break large, complex topics down into digestible pieces, or "chunks". Ut vix primis eripuit offendit, inani
						soluta accusata at eum. Sed ad illum populo cetero, dico persequeris pri ut, senserit prodesset
						interpretaris
						per id. Sit ut lobortis similique. Duis iudico eirmod nam et, perpetua vituperata elaboraret his id.

						His ei possit periculis elaboraret. Vide affert necessitatibus at his, ne fugit aliquip pro. Facilisis
						dissentias no sea, est scaevola appetere apeirian ex. Est ad autem diceret intellegam, te autem percipit
						recteque cum. Munere numquam te vis, cum id praesent honestatis signiferumque.
